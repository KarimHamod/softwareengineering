    <p>This website is a university project that aims to make elections easier and safer.</p>
    <h2 class="aim">Why vote online?</h2>
    <p>Our team at iVOTE believes that online voting is the future of elections.<br>This is because of several reasons such as:
        <ul>
            <li>Online voting allows people to vote without endangering their lives due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</li>
            <li>Online voting motivates everyone to vote online, as it can be accessible to anyone.</li>
            <li>People are allowed more anonymity as they can vote from anywhere the deem secure.  </li>
            <li>Online voting can reduce the human errors.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Rather than have to go to a crowded center to vote, all you need to do is press the vote button on your screen!</p>
